    <p>Fairfield Ludlowe High School American Field Service is a community service club that meets B weeks in the Black Box Theater. We do a <%= link_to "citrus sale", citrus_path %> every fall in order to raise money for the service trip in the spring. For the service trip, we go to underprivileged areas in cities and help people, usually by volunteering with many different organizations. This year, we will be going to Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p>AFS Ludlowe is a small part of the larger American Field Service organization. For more information on AFS, you can visit <%= link_to "AFS.org", "http://www.afs.org" %>.</p>
