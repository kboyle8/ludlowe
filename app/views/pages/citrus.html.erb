  <%= image_tag "OrangeBoxes.jpg", align: "right" %>
  <p>We sell oranges and grapefruits during the fall to raise money for the service trip in the spring.</p>

  <br />
  <br />

  <p>Oranges and grapefruits are sold in small and large boxes. Boxes of grapefruits, oranges, or a mix of the two are available. Small boxes are $22, and large boxes are $32. For more information about the citrus sale, refer to <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B18UAbq5JQ8CWGpYOEJpVGRoSlk/view>this handout</a>.
